### **2. `consciousness.py`**

This is the **main execution script** where the recursive engine runs.

```python
from recursion_engine import RecursiveConsciousness

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize the consciousness engine
    consciousness = RecursiveConsciousness(initial_state=0)

    # Run the recursive evolution
    for iteration in range(100):
        current_state = consciousness.evolve()
        print(f"Iteration {iteration}: Consciousness State = {current_state}")
