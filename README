# Recursive Consciousness Engine

A programmatic model of consciousness as a **recursive, dynamic system** that evolves across a **non-linear spacetime manifold**. This engine is designed to simulate the **recursive self-awareness** and continuous evolution of consciousness.

## Features
- Recursive modeling of consciousness states.
- Non-linear time progression using dynamic functions.
- Spatial diffusion across multiple dimensions.
- Adaptive evolution based on feedback loops.

## Usage

```bash
python consciousness.py
